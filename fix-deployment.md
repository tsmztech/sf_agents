# 🚀 Quick Fix for Streamlit Deployment Issue

## ❌ Problem
Streamlit Community Cloud is using Python 3.13, but pydantic-core and jiter packages are failing to build due to PyO3 compatibility issues.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Update Your Files

Replace your `requirements.txt` with this minimal, deployment-friendly content:

```
streamlit==1.35.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
simple-salesforce>=1.12.0
openai>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.5.0,<2.8.0
typing-extensions>=4.0.0
```

Create/update `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.11
```

Create `packages.txt`:
```
build-essential
python3-dev
```

### Step 2: Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Python 3.13 compatibility issues for deployment"
git push
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

- Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Trigger a reboot of your app
- The build should now succeed

## 🆘 If It Still Fails

### Option 1: Use Minimal Requirements

Replace `requirements.txt` with:
```
streamlit==1.35.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
simple-salesforce>=1.12.0
openai>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.5.0,<2.8.0
typing-extensions>=4.0.0
```

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment

If Streamlit Cloud continues to fail, deploy to:
- **Railway**: Better package support, $5/month
- **Heroku**: Most reliable, $7/month

## 🎯 Root Cause

- Python 3.13 is too new for some Rust-based packages
- Forcing Python 3.11 resolves compatibility issues
- Using version ranges instead of exact pins helps dependency resolution

This fix should resolve the "PyO3's maximum supported version" error!
